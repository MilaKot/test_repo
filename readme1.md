# The main distinction between git pull and git fetch actions.
## git fetch
Downloads all history from the remote tracking branches

## git pull 
Updates your current local working branch with all new commits from the corresponding remote branch on GitHub. **git pull** is a combination of __git fetch__ and __git merge__.

## git merge 
Combines remote tracking branches into current local branch
