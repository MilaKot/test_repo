# The main distinction between git pull and git fetch actions.
## git pull 
Uploads all local branch commits to GitHub
## git fetch
Synchronize your local repository with the remote repository on GitHub.com
### Distinctions:
Updates your current local working branch with all new commits from the corresponding remote branch on GitHub. **git pull** is a combination of __git fetch__ and __git merge__.

+ git merge - Downloads all history from the remote tracking branches
