# The main distinction between git pull and git fetch actions.
## git fetch
Downloads all history from the remote tracking branches

## git pull 
Updates your current local working branch with all new commits from the corresponding remote branch on GitHub. **git pull** is a combination of __git fetch__ and __git merge__.

## git merge 
Combines remote tracking branches into current local branch

### Changing the Last Commit
Changing your most recent commit is probably the most common rewriting of history that you’ll do. You’ll often want to do two basic things to your last commit: *simply change the commit message*, or *change the actual content of the commit by adding, removing and modifying files*.


**git commit --amend**
